# KA-exporter
Source files that exported Khan Academy projects use.
Code is largely built from the [KA Template](https://github.com/prolightHub/KaTemplate/tree/master) repo.

**processing.js** is a file that appears to have been modified to support degrees.
**loadKA.js** is a modified script taken from the referenced repo. Some changes include a canvas that can be resized, even fullscreen (without any changes to code), while still keeping the sharp edges and textures.
